                    <p style="font-size: 1em;" class="lead">The child in Chickamauga expresses love for many things
                        throughout the short story.
                        One of the major things that the boy loves is his father. Though during the story he does not
                        have specific contact with his father it can easily be inferred that he has a deep love for his
                        father based on his disillusioned version on the realities of war and his idolization of his
                        father. Throughout the novel, the boy idolizes his father saying that “in his younger manhood
                        the father had been a soldier” and had even shown the boy “military books and pictures’ proving
                        an obvious relationship in the child’s mind between the love of his father and war (Bierce 1).
                        This connection to his father also reveals his vague desire to be loved an accepted by his
                        father because he is a “deaf-mute” and he believes that by being like his father and by
                        following the “dominion of his heritage” he will be appreciated by his father (Bierce 3). This
                        love that the boy expresses is shown through obsessive behavior toward war because of his faith
                        and love in his father. The excessive behavior behind the boy’s love is blatantly shown in the
                        short story in the boy’s fantasy’s about war when he moves across the field fighting “his
                        imaginary foe” and comparing himself to a “mightier conqueror” who can not “curb the lust for
                        war”, showing that his disillusionment of reality is a direct result of his love and admiration
                        for his father (Bierce 1).

                        Another person that the boy from Chickamauga loves is his mother, it is shown in the text that
                        the boy cares very greatly for his mother. This can be found in the text when the boy is
                        frightened by the rabbit he “fled” calling in “inarticulate cries for his mother”(Bierce 1). By
                        the boy doing this it shows his love for his mother because despite the events in the story the
                        little boy rarely showed fear, but in one of his few moments of terror he called out for his
                        mother, showing his innocence and childlike comfort he finds in his mother. The text also shows
                        the boy’s love for his mother at the end of the short story when the boy finds his mother dead
                        after the battle, the text explains that after he finds her dead the body he ‘moved his little
                        hands, making wild, uncertain gestures” and “uttered a series of inarticulate and indesirable
                        cries” demonstrating his utter grief and in showing such intense grief it shows his legitimate
                        love for his mother (Bierce 3). The boys' love for his mother is also shown by his change in
                        perspective of the war, up until the death of his mother the boy idolized the idea of war, but
                        after the traumatic event of her death he no longer saw war as something to enjoy but instead
                        starts to gain a sense of reality and views the war as a “wreck” and through this loss of
                        innocence he demonstrates his love for his mother (Bierce 3).

                        One object that the character loves in the short story, Chickamauga is his wooden sword. The
                        boy’s love of his wooden sword very transparently displays the boy’s disillusionment and
                        fascination toward war. Throughout the short story, the boy carries a wooden sword that he “bore
                        bravely”(Bierce 1). The boy’s love of the sword was made form his memory of his father’s
                        “military books and pictures” which his father loved (Bierce 1). Because of his love and
                        admiration of his father and of his father’s past he creates his sword in an attempt to connect
                        with him, therefore making the sword symbolic for his admiration of his father despite being a
                        “deaf-mute”(Bierce 3). The text also shows the boy’s love for the sword when he physically finds
                        comfort in it, holding it with a “tighter clutch in unconsciousness” showing that even in his
                        sleep he finds comfort in it, this reveals his childish desire to be comforted, and through the
                        symbolic representation of the sword’s correlation to his fantasies about war, when he clutches
                        it, this represents his character wanting to hold on to his innocence despite his brutal
                        surroundings (Bierce 3).
