                    In Ambrose Bierce’s short story  “Chickamauga” the reader follows a young boy during the Civil War. The story begins with the child leaving his “rude home in a small field” and going into the nearby forest (Bierce 1). While in the forest, the child plays make believe war with his a homemade wooden sword. While playing the child encounters a rabbit which causes the child to be overcome by fear, “and with a startled cry the child turned and fled, he knew not in what direction” causing himself to get lost (Bierce 1). Unable to find his way home, the distressed child falls asleep in the forest. Once he wakes up the child continues his search to find his way back home, while doing so he discovers wounded soldiers retreating after a gruesome battle. The child follows the soldiers “in motion towards the creek” which eventually leads him to a plantation with engulfed in flames as a result of the battle that occured while the boy was asleep. The plantation ended up being his home, where he finds the body of his mother who had died while he was gone.

                    By getting lost in the forest and having to find his way back home, the child goes through a journey which tests his innocence and his reality. At the beginning of the story, the child has a very romanticized fantasy of war, only knowing of the war through his father who “in his younger manhood the father had been a soldier”(Bierce 1).  While searching for his way back home, the child goes through first hands accounts of war and the devastation it can cause. Through each instance, the child's slowly begins to lose his innocence as a result. While the child was with the retreating wounded soldiers, he didn't realize that many were dying on their way to the creek. The child viewed the soldiers “with childish curiosity,” and watched the soldiers finding amusement in the “maimed and bleeding men, as heedless as he of the dramatic contrast between his laughter and their own ghastly gravity,” showing how he is oblivious of the situation he is in (Bierce 2). He continued to follow them to the creek and, due to a nearby fire from a familiar plantation, the child is able to see the blood in it the creek, along with fatally wounded soldiers including some with no heads. This causes the reality of what's happen around him to finally sink in even though what innocence he has left is shielding him from this traumatic experience, “even is his hospital understanding could not accept a phenomenon implying such vitality”(Bierce 3). When discovering the familiar plantation on fire was his home, he quickly rushed to it. The child found his mother's dead body when he returned to his home, her body left with “the greater part of the forehead [was] torn away, and from the jagged hole the brain protruded, overflowing the temple, a frothy mass of gray, crowned with clusters of crimson bubbles- the work of a shell”(Bierce 3). Upon the trumatic discovery of his mother's body, in that instance the child's innocence is completely lost and he is snapped into the true reality of what's happening around him and the true destruction war causes.
