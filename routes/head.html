                        In the story Chickamauga, the child embraces an intense desire and lust for the perceived glory of war. Inspired by his father, a soldier that had fought in wars of the past “against naked savages and followed the flag of his country”, the child dreamed and fantasizes over the thrill of battle (Bierce 1). The child desperately dreams and wants to be a warrior whom is “born to war and dominion as a heritage” (Bierce 1). Throughout the story the child is obsessed with a ignorant dream of being a soldier while being oblivious to the reality of what war really is. The inner philosophies of the boy are likely the most intriguing as they contrast each other greatly. While the child revels in the sight of war and plays with the decaying injured soldiers, it is the calm innocent portions of nature that terrify him. When the boy saw a rabbit “it frightened and repelled him” while when the boy sees the dying soldier, he sees him as “a merry spectacle” and attempts to ride him (Bierce 1-2). This shows the ignorance of the child and how his sheltered youth led to illogical personal philosophies fostered by his unfortunate financial status, lack of education, and communicative disabilities.

                        <br>
                        
                        Almost the entire story of Chickamauga is shown through the private thoughts and feelings of the boy. This is likely because of his nature, being that he was “a deaf mute” (Bierce 3). As a result, we find out the past of the boy, his relationship to his father, the inner fears and desires of the boy, as well as his feeling towards the unexplained. While the child prolongs his innocence, it is the unknown that scares him. It is only the “oddly familiar appearance” of his home in the distance that breaks him out of his wartime fantasies into reality (Bierce 3). The unknown creatures of the forest terrify the boy, while the soldiers who remind him of painted clowns, excites the boy. These inner thoughts establish the ever present ignorance and innocence of the boy to the harshness of reality that make the revelation at the end of the story much more impactful as the connection is made.
