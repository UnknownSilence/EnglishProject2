                    <p style="font-size: 1.50em;" class="lead">Since the child is so young, he really only has innocent
                        instincts when he enters the woods. For the endurance of his life, he has lived a very sheltered
                        life, being protected from the realities of life by his mother and the house/field servants.
                        When the boy encounters the crawling men, the audience sees his true instincts, as he
                        “approached one of these crawling figures from behind and with an agile movement mounted it
                        astride” (Bierce 2). The boy is too young and too inexperienced to really understand the
                        severity of this situation, and although the audience views this as childish, this is the only
                        reality he knows of, as “he had seen his father’s negroes creep upon their hands and knees for
                        his amusement-- had ridden them so, “making believe” they were his horses” (Bierce 2). The
                        character is too young to be self-conscious of his actions or thoughts, or hide things from
                        others in society and his life. However, I believe that the little boy is pained by the
                        destruction of his childhood/innocence. At the end of the story, the little boy sees his home in
                        flames, along with his dead mother in the yard, causing him to throw his sword, once considered
                        a symbol of his childhood as he played a war game, into the fire as “a surrender to the superior
                        forces of nature,” which could be considered to be the realization of the real world (Bierce 3).
                        Although he faces the dead bodies and wounded soldiers with “childish curiosity,” he views
                        simple creatures such as a small white rabbit as a threat and runs off in fear (Bierce 2). His
                        oblivion from the real world causes him to fear the harmless and his belief that the soldiers
                        are acting out scenes from the war as “a merry spectacle” (Bierce 2).
