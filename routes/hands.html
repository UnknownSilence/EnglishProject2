                    <p style="font-size: 1.50em;" class="lead">The main conflict the boy faces throughout the short
                        story would be the struggle of the disillusionment of war. Since the child is still very young,
                        he has only experienced what war is through what his father has shared with him through
                        pictures. These pictures are often staged with an air of grace and grandeur, so naturally, those
                        are the traits the child associates with war. Enticed by the notion of war, this leads the child
                        to act as he does throughout the story. However, what makes this a conflict during the story is
                        that he is actually in the middle of a battlefield, face to face with war itself, and is unable
                        to initially recognize this. We can see this as the boy with “an agile movement mounted [a
                        soldier] astride” and pretended that the man was a horse (Bierce 2). Instead of recognizing the
                        in truth the man was very weak and barely able to hold himself, the child makes the connection
                        to how many of the servants who worked on his family plantation would play “pretend” with him.

                        Due to issues hinted in the story, such as being deaf, this also drives further the conflict of
                        not being able to understand everything that takes place around him. For example, while the
                        young child is off playing and wandering around, he is unaware of the growing amount of danger
                        which surrounds him and his home. This inflicts worry on his family and their servants, who were
                        “hastily searching the fields and hedges in alarm” in order to find him, most likely to avoid
                        being harshly reprimanded (Bierce 1). Nonetheless, many of the soldiers seemed to almost ignore
                        him to some regard, as the child “moved among them freely, going from one to another and peering
                        into their faces with childish curiosity” (Bierce 2). While the soldiers may have let him be
                        because these were enemy soldiers, it could have also been due to the fact that they were too
                        focussed on fighting their adversaries to worry about a child and his family.
